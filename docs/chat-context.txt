Goal: Build a production-grade, hands-on DevOps project for an interview at InfraCloud Technologies.

1. Project Origin & Business Context
Company: Global Sleep Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (Brand: GloSleep Mattresses)

Business: Sells mattresses, pillows, and foam. Manages a supply chain from manufacturers to distributors.

Project Goal: To build a real-world "GloSleep Order Management" application to demonstrate deep, practical DevOps, Cloud, and Infrastructure automation skills.

2. Technical Vision & Stack Decisions (Architecture Decisions Record)
Architecture: Microservices (5 core services).

Services: Auth, Inventory, Order, Procurement, Analytics.

Backend: Node.js + Express for all services.

Database: MongoDB (deployed via Bitnami Helm chart with persistence).

Orchestration: Kubernetes (local: Kind, target: AWS EKS).

CI/CD: GitHub Actions.

IaC: Terraform (for future AWS setup).

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana stack.

Docs: Docs-as-Code approach in /docs directory.

3. Current Project State (As of 20-09-2025)
Repository: https://github.com/anshumandash1506/glosleep-platform

Code Complete: All 5 microservices are implemented in /src with Dockerfiles and health checks.

Documentation: Foundation is laid in /docs with ADRs and overview.

Pending DevOps Tasks:

Deploy MongoDB to Kind cluster via Helm.

Write Kubernetes Manifests (Deployments, Services) for all 5 services.

Build a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow to test, build, and push images.

Deploy the full stack to Kubernetes.

Set up monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.

4. Key Narrative for Interview (The "Story")
The project is designed to showcase:

Automation First: From code commit to deployed container.

Production Mindset: Health checks, security (non-root users), persistence, monitoring.

Cloud-Native Expertise: Kubernetes, Helm, microservices design.

Business Understanding: The services directly map to real business domains (Sales, Inventory, Procurement).

Problem-Solving: The approach to solving the local image issue with a professional CI/CD pipeline.

5. Immediate Next Steps
Deploy Database: helm install glosleep-mongodb bitnami/mongodb --set auth.rootPassword=... --set persistence.enabled=true

Create K8s Manifests: Write YAML for each service's Deployment and Service.

Create CI/CD Pipeline: Build GitHub Actions workflow to build and push images on git push.
